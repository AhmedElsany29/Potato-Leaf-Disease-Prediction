🌿***Potato Leaf Disease Prediction – Harnessing AI to Improve Agriculture***

I’m thrilled to share my latest project on Potato Leaf Disease Prediction, where I utilized machine learning and deep learning techniques to detect and classify diseases in potato leaves. This project aims to help farmers identify crop diseases early, enabling them to take preventive actions and improve overall productivity.

🔍 Project Overview:
The main objective of this project is to build a reliable model that can accurately predict diseases in potato leaves. Early detection is crucial in protecting crops and ensuring better yields, which makes this work valuable for modern precision agriculture.

🛠️ Tools & Techniques:
- Python 🐍
- Keras & TensorFlow: To build and train deep learning models.
- Scikit-learn: For model evaluation and accuracy scoring.
- CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks): To classify leaf images as either healthy or diseased.

🌱 Modeling:

I implemented a CNN model to classify the leaf images, achieving strong results. The model was trained with various image preprocessing techniques, such as augmentation, to enhance accuracy and robustness.

🔧 Performance:
- MobileNet achieved an impressive validation accuracy of 98.33%, making it the most effective model for this task.
- DenseNet121 also performed well with an accuracy of 99.11%.

These models demonstrate the potential of AI in revolutionizing agricultural practices through fast and accurate disease detection, leading to better crop management.
